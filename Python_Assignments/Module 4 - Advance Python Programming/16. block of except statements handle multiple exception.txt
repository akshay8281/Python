16. Can one block of except statements handle multiple exception?

Yes, a single `except` block can handle multiple exceptions by specifying them within a tuple. This is useful when you want to handle different exceptions in the same way. Here's an example:

////

try:
    # Some code that may raise exceptions
    file = open("myfile.txt", "r")
    result = 10 / 0
except (FileNotFoundError, ZeroDivisionError):
    # This block will handle FileNotFoundError and ZeroDivisionError
    print("An error occurred")

////

In this example, if either opening the file or dividing by zero raises an exception, the `except` block will catch it and print `"An error occurred"`.

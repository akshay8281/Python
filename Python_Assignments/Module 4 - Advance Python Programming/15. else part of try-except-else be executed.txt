15. When will the else part of try-except-else be executed?
Ans :

The `else` block in a `try-except-else` statement is executed when no exceptions are raised in the `try` block. If an exception occurs, the `except` block is executed instead, and the `else` block is skipped. Here's a basic example to illustrate this:

''''''
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # This block will be executed if a ZeroDivisionError occurs
    print("Error: Division by zero!")
else:
    # This block will be executed if no exceptions occur
    print("Division result:", result)
''''''

In this example, since `10 / 2` does not raise any exceptions, the `else` block will be executed, and it will print `Division result: 5`.

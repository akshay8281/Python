01. What is File function in python? What is keywords to create and write file.

Certainly! Here are examples of how to use the file modes `'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, `'r+'`, and `'w+'` in Python without using the `with` statement:

=> `'r'` Mode: Read
>> Description : Opens the file for reading only.
>> File must exist : Yes.
>> Pointer position : Beginning of the file.


file = open('example.txt', 'r')
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()


=> `'w'` Mode: Write
>> Description : Opens the file for writing.
>> File must exist : No (creates a new file if it doesn't exist).
>> Pointer position : Beginning of the file (truncates the file if it exists).


file = open('example.txt', 'w')
file.write('Hello, World!')
file.close()


=> 'a' Mode: Append
>> Description : Opens the file for appending.
>> File must exist : No (creates a new file if it doesn't exist).
>> Pointer position : End of the file.


file = open('example.txt', 'a')
file.write('Appending a new line.\n')
file.close()


=> 'r+' Mode: Read and Write
>> Description : Opens the file for both reading and writing.
>> File must exist : Yes.
>> Pointer position : Beginning of the file.


file = open('example.txt', 'r+')
content = file.read()  print(content)
file.write('\nAdding a new line at the end.') 
file.close()


=> 'w+' Mode: Write and Read
>> Description : Opens the file for both writing and reading.
>> File must exist : No (creates a new file if it doesn't exist).
>> Pointer position : Beginning of the file (truncates the file if it exists).


file = open('example.txt', 'w+')
file.write('Hello, World!')
file.seek(0)  
content = file.read()  print(content)
file.close()


=>  Summary
>> 'r' : Read only. File must exist.
>> 'w' : Write only. Creates a new file or truncates an existing one.
>> 'a' : Append only. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist. Writes at the end of the file.
>> 'r+' : Read and write. File must exist.
>> 'w+' : Write and read. Creates a new file or truncates an existing one.

18. What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed?
Ans :


When the expression `"1" == 1` is executed in Python, it compares a string (`"1"`) with an integer (`1`). Since the types are different, Python does not consider them equal, even though the string `"1"` contains the character `1` which is the same value as the integer `1`. 

In Python, when you compare objects of different types using `==`, the result is always `False`. If you want to compare them based on their values, you need to convert them to the same type. For example:

/// 
# Comparing after converting the string to an integer
print(int("1") == 1)  # Output: True
///

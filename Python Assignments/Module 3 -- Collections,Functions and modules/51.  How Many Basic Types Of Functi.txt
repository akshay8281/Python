51.  How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?
Ans : 

In Python, there are three basic types of functions:

1. **Built-in Functions**: These are functions that are built into the Python interpreter and are always available for use. Examples include `print()`, `len()`, `type()`, etc.

2. **User-defined Functions**: These are functions that users create themselves using the `def` keyword. They allow users to group statements together to perform a specific task. Example:

>>>>>>

   def greet(name):
       print(f"Hello, {name}!")

   greet("Alice")

>>>>>>>

3. **Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions)**: These are small, anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They are often used when a simple function is needed for a short period of time. Example:

>>>>>>>

   add = lambda x, y: x + y
   print(add(2, 3))

>>>>>>>

These are the basic types of functions in Python, each serving a different purpose and use case.

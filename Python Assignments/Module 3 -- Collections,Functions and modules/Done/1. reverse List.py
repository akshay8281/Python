# 1. What is List? How will you reverse a list?

'''
In Python, a list is a collection of items, which can be of different types,
stored in a specific order. Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be
changed after the list is created.

sliceReverse = ["A","B","C","D","E"]
reverseMethod = sliceReverse [::-1]
print(reverseMethod)
